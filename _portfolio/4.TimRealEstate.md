### About the project  

This was to be a Real Estate site that was also a personal site. As a realtor, Tim wanted a site that would give clients an idea of who he is as well as a tool to connect to properties. Trust is such a big issue when making the decision to buy a house, Tim wanted it to inspire confidence. The site needed to present Tim as professional, personable and capable realtors that had it all covered.  

### My Role   

We used a wordpress theme.
Tim had some good example sites for me to look at but was pretty loose on design which gave me plenty of room to play. I want the site to be dynamic and modern to reflect Tim's values. The hero image moves smoothly into place and the property search form pops up when you hover over it. I added a custom logo which draws itself in discreetly.
Tim was very excited about the logo and immediately adopted it as his identity in all his marketing and advertising.
