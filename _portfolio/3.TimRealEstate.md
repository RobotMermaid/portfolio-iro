**About the project**  
A Real Estate site that was also a personal site. As a realtor, Tim wanted a site that would give clients an idea of who he was aswell as connect to properties. Trust is such a big issue when making the decision to buy a house, Tim wanted it to inspire confidence.
  
**My Role**  
I was excited at the oportunity and was willing to do whatever. Even went above and beyond creating a logo for him
 
 **The Challenge**  
Buying a house is a huge endeavor, both financially and emotionally. We wanted to inspire confidence by pesenting Tim and his team as profesionnal, personable and capable realtors that had it all covered. 
 
**The Answer**  
Tim sent me links to websites that inspired him and projected the feel he was after. I gleaned a little from all of them and created a site that was customized to his goal.
 
 **In the End**
Even though the site was not used it was fun working on it.
