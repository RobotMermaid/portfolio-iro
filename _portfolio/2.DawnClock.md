**About the project**  
This alarm clock doesn't ring, it shines. It recreates the full spectrum of an aurora borealis on the ceiling to gently wake you up without a sound so that others may sleep in.
  
**My Role**  
I had been experiementing with arduinos and leds and so this was the perfect oportunity to put them to go use. I used the adafruit website for inspiration. Using a similar project's tutorial, I adapted it to my needs using Prcessing.
 
 **The Challenge**  
The clock had to create enough light to wake me up without being jarring.  It needed to be reliable and fit on the nightstand. I wanted it to look neat when not in operation (no pile of wires showing) and stand alone (not be hooked up to the computer or another device.
The biggest dificulty was in keeping time. Allthough the little time piece inside (the DS3231 Precision RTC Breakout  from Adafruit) would read the time from a satelite, it could only do so when in direct view of the sky.
 
**The Answer**  
Movement grabs attention so my first thought was to create an animation that would explain what ProfHire does.
I presented my idea to the team and they were very excited about it. They all agreed that an animation was a good solution to the problem. 
We worked out the other elements that should go on the page as well as the basic parts of the animation.
I created the illustrations for the basic image from actual school buildings as well as the application. I used a combination of svg and png that I worked out in Sketch.
The illustrations would have to stay side by side and align just right so that the movement made sense.
The most complicated part was to get the svgs to behave properly accross different web browsers. Integrating it was also difficult and took alot of massaging.
 
 **In the End**
The Dawn alarm worked for a month or two before it started to falter. No efforts on my part were able to put it back on the right time. I believe that the first power source I used was faulty. It would cause the clock to emit a few bursts of its brightest light before beginning it's normal sequence. The problem was fixed by using a higher quality power source but the damage may have all ready been done.
