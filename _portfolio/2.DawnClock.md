### The Idea

This alarm clock doesn't ring, it shines. It recreates the full spectrum of an aurora borealis on the ceiling to gently wake you up without a sound so that others may sleep in.  
[Here is what it looks like in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWyOwYFFB6o)  

I wanted to experiment with arduinos and leds and so this was the perfect opportunity to try it out. The adafruit website had all the code and parts I needed. I Used a similar project's tutorial which was for an [analog clock display.](https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-powered-analog-meter-clock/code?view=all) The code is in C which I had never dealt with before but looking at the patterns it was easy enough to figure out what was happening.

### The Project  

The clock had to create enough light to wake me up without being jarring. It needed to be reliable and fit on the nightstand. I wanted it to look neat when not in operation (no pile of wires showing) and stand alone (not be hooked up to the computer).
The biggest difficulty was in keeping time. All though the little time piece inside (the DS3231 Precision RTC Breakout) would read the time from a satellite, it could only do so when in direct view of the sky.

### The Hard Part

 This project was some of the first coding I ever did.

 The hardest part was to figure out what to include. Getting things set up right was cryptic. There were many tutorials to work through and new concepts to ingest.    

````
   #include <TinyWireM.h>  // library for the Trinket    
   #include <USI_TWI_Master.h>  // library for the Trinket    
   #include <TinyRTClib.h>  // library for the clock    
   #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>  // library for the lights    

````        

Then I had to get it configured to my setup:  

````
    RTC_DS1307 rtc;  
    #define PIN 3  
    #define START_MINUTE 54  
    uint8_t alarm = 18;  
    Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(16, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

`````  

And get everything primed:  

````  
    void setup () {
    //Serial.begin(57600);
    strip.begin();
    strip.show();
    //Wire.begin();
    //RTC.begin();
    TinyWireM.begin(); // Begin I2C
    rtc.begin(); // Begin DS1307 real time clock
    //  if (! RTC.isrunning()) {
    //    Serial.println("RTC is NOT running!");
    // following line sets the RTC to the date & time this sketch was compiled
       rtc.adjust(DateTime(__DATE__, __TIME__)); }
````   

Working out the colors and patterns was the fun part. I spent hours trying to get it just right. It had to start out rather dim and gradually become brighter.  

### At Last  

The Dawn alarm worked for a month or two before it started to falter. No efforts on my part were able to put it back on the right time. I believe that the first power source I used was faulty. It would cause the clock to emit a few bursts of its brightest light before beginning it's normal sequence. The problem was fixed by using a higher quality power source but the damage may have already been done. I think I need to learn more about electronic circuits and resistors.
