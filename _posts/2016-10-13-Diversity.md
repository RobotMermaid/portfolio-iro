There is alot of talk about diversity going around. Most articles will point to statistics that prove the point that diverse companies do better than the rest. Few will venture into the grey of why that works. They seem to quickly loop back to saying: "Diversity matters because diversity matters." 
So to break out of that paradigm, I want to explore exactly what diversity is.
First, the obvious.
Diversity means that people have certain differences mainly:  
	• Gender   
	• Ethnicity  
	• Disabilities  
	• Age	 
	• Sexual Orientation  
and that doesn't actually affect their ability to function as employees.
And yet we have these stereotypes that stop us form hiring people based on these differences because of how we perceive them.

But what  if the diversified companies that do so well didn't owe their success to diversity itself. What if these companies were more succesful simply because they reach out form their comfort zones and embrace the uncomfortable? 

Diversity is nothing without inclusion. Making everyone feel like they have a chance to contribute to the company. The Enterprise is a perfect representation of a diverse and inclusive society where gender race and even species are all included and contribute to the best of their ability. Anyone can contact the bridge at any time, everyone has a voice. It is expected that people will moderate themselves.
