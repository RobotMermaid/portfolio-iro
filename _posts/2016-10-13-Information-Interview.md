title: the Information Interview
---

My first reaction to having to do an information interview was visceral. Having to go ask someone I don't know, to take precious time out of their busy day, to talk to me about what they do, sounded like a very bad idea.

It stayed that way for a while.

The breakthrough cam when, at a meetup, mentioning my anxiety, a fellow coder exclaimed: "I love information interviews!" Needless to say, I was puzzled. She quickly continued with this brief explanation: "I've found that people love talking about themselves." She said more but that was the part that made the light go on for me. In an Information Interview, I would not be the one the attention would be on. It would be a window into someone else's reality. . . and they would enjoy the chance to share.
Needless to say that armed with that gracious attitude this young coder gave me, I proceeded to jump at the opportunity to ask anyone I could about their life as a programmer. 


Now I ask too many questions.
