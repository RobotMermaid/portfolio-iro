* Treehouse
* HackBright Academy
* Bloc.io


I started taking online courses for programming  in September 2013. At first I tried different sites including youtube and settled on Lynda.com for a while.  Simon Allardice has a wonderful way of explaining the fundamental concepts of programming and of Javascript. In May 2014, I wanted something more structured than Lynda and decided on Treehouse.com where my favorite teachers were Nick Pettit and Guil Hernandez. They, and a few others,  walked me through the Web Design Path aswell as the Front End Development path. I was commited to learning and I had the luck to be able to take my time and really wrap my brain around what I was learning. 150 hours later, I was almost through my third track : Full Stack Javascript. That's when I decided I wanted to take this up a level and I needed more help than Treehouse could give. I wanted tangible projects that would show off my skills and to put myself through that test of determination that a bootcamp is. I had explored the possibilty of jumping in to the programming world alone.  That's when with the participation of my busy husband, we created [RangelWorks](http://rangelworks.com/) . I really enjoyed doing the animations. The possibilties were endless, but doing the work and finding the work were 2 different jobs and I was only good at one.

I even gave up on the whole thing and got a job as a Production person for Berkeley's own North Altantic Books. The expereience was fun but quickly become boring and I missed the challenge of programming.

The time had come to find a boot camp to get me through that last mile of learning and creating some awesome projects. The search was on.  HackBright quickly popped to the top of my favorites list mostly because they had reasonable hours. Having struggled through some rather difficult concepts on Treehouse, I didn't believe anyone could learn much of anything in 4 intense months of nonstop input.  Your brain needs to process. To do something else. How many times does a solution simply come to you after taking a break? 
I went through their whole application process and spoke with the wonderful Dori.  In the end, they didn't take me. I was crushed...for a whole day. The search continued. Much introspection was done. More research...brought me to online boot camps. They offered the best of both worlds.

Having spoken to a few HackBright alumni it seemed that the retention rate is said to be about 20%. There will be tears, I was told. I would be challenged. Yes, but to what end? To see if I would give up?
