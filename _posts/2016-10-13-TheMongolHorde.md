I grew up moving often. We changed homes every 2 or 3 years and that usually meant changing countries too. Different was the name of the game and I loved it.   

Curious about all I was hearing about diversity recently I set out to read what people are saying about this. All of the articles I found pointed to statistics that show that diverse companies do better than the rest. They had numbers. They were adamant that diversity matters. Few ventured into the grey of why that works. They seemed to quickly loop back to saying: "Diversity matters because diversity matters."

So to break out of that paradigm, I wanted to explore exactly what diversity is.
First, the obvious.
Diversity means that people have certain differences:  
	• Gender   
	• Ethnicity  
	• Disabilities  
	• Age	 
	• Sexual Orientation  
	and these differences don't affect their work ethics and ability.

Now, the uncomfortable.
We like to be in our comfort zones. We generally like to be around people who are like us. We naturally gravitate to the familiar. Having a highly diverse group of people is likely to spark conflict and misunderstandings.

But from chaos comes new ideas, and new solutions...

Enter the Mongol Horde.  
["Many people were slaughtered in the course of Genghis Khan’s invasions, but he also granted religious freedom to his subjects, abolished torture, encouraged trade and created the first international postal system." ](http://www.history.com/topics/genghis-khan)
Genghis Khan and other successful conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Napoleon didn't try to manage their huge territories,  they relied on the people there to continue controlling the area in their name. Genghis Khan intentionally broke up tribes to keep people loyal only to him. He "put competent allies rather than relatives in key positions". He forced situations where people were outside their comfort zones and had to cooperate, and he was inclusive. He also was not concerned with comfort zones.
Genghis Khan enforced freedom of religion. Alexander took a [Persian wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxana). Napoleon became a [son of Islam](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20843506-napoleon-and-islam). They all embraced the cultures of the places they conquered. They embraced diversity and made it work for them.

And so Star Trek.  
Diversity is nothing without inclusion. Making everyone feel like they have a chance to contribute to the Enterprise is the other side of having a variety of different people onboard. Respect and acceptance are given to all. When an employee becomes a problem he is not fired, his superiors try to figure him out so as to give him a better chance to contribute (The Next Generation "Hollow Pursuits"). The Enterprise is a perfect representation of a diverse and inclusive society where gender, race, age, and even other species are all valued and contribute to the best of their ability.

Be more like Star Trek, not the Mongol Horde.
