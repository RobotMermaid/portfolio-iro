I am looking for a job in 
## Me in a nutshell:

* I play capoeira 
* I'm learning to play the ukulele
* I have 1 dog 2 cats 2 chickens and many fish 
* I have many indoor plants
* I ride a scooter
* I speak French natively, Spanish haltingly and German hesitantly

Growing up I was what is now called a [third culture kid.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid)  I lived in 5 countries before I came to California at 18.  The internet was a window to the world for me and I want to live there. I enjoy the challenge of understanding other things. 

I am compulsively creative and love to bring a project to life. The feeling of accomplishment from making an idea become a reality is one of my favorite things in the world. I have explored many different arts and crafts from knitting, sculpting, creating games and painting.  I found that the things I enjoy are the same things that drive me in programming: Inspiration, Flow, and Production.

I used to work for a weekly newspaper. That environemnt shaped my expectations of work. I thrive in a  fast paced deadline driven environment. Solving problems is a constant and is highly motivating to me. Working as a team to get the finished product out on time and as best we could was satisfying.

Lately I am fascinated by the incorporation of technology in every day life. Technology is now a mundane part of our lives and I want to be part of that integration. It requires alot of humanity to incorporate in ways that benefit us in the long run.
When I get more time I intend to dive into electronics (Arduinos & leds).
My fun thing to do is svg animations in css and design.

That enthusiasm for production is something i bring to everything in my life. 


   
   
   

Project manager and artist who found coding and hasn't looked back.

I’ve been learning programming over the past 3 years, taking the time to dive deeply into the concepts and exploring the technologies available.   
I just finished a coding boot camp. I found the expereince to be invigorating . I can't wait to continue learning with real project. 

I’ve been attending conferences and meetups to get to know the community and see what is new in the industry and I am hungry to learn more (everything?)  


After being a mother, an artist, and freelance designer I want to continue my career with a supprotive software company which values maintaining a life/work/community balance that benefits all.  I learn fast and I'm motivated to work on real life projects
