### Project manager and artist who found coding and hasn't looked back.

See what I've been doing on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/RobotMermaid)  

For a peek at my [Resume.](https://goo.gl/ghqBAX)  

I have a pretty wide range of valuable experience and skills including API development, 
code maintenance, programming, bugfixing, problem solving, collaborating with product development, 
data schemas, authentication, aws/containers/docker/kubernetes, agile development, etc.
Plus working with a genuine deployed application, and a pretty complex one for that matter! 

  
I have the skills and training needed to help develop and maintain software programs and to make improvements that will enhance functionality. I have outstanding problem solving skills with the ability to work with technical and abstract concepts efficiently. I also have solid knowledge of JavaScript, Ruby on Rails HTML and CSS. A good understanding of back-end development best practices and hands-on software troubleshooting experience.  
I pay close attention to details and I have the ability to stay focused on the task at hand for long periods to get the job done.  
I love diving into code and figuring out what makes it tick.  
Iâ€™ve been attending conferences and meet-ups at every chance to see what is new such as React and get to know the community. I am hungry to learn more (everything?)


#### Me in a nutshell:

* I love to learn and help others learn too
* I get a kick out of making things
* I practice horse archery
* I speak French natively, Spanish haltingly, German hesitantly, and Klingon sporadically!


Growing up I was what is now called a [third culture kid.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid)  I lived in 5 countries before I came to California at 18. The experience made me forever curious about how people think. The internet is a window to the larger world and I can't get enough. I enjoy the challenge of understanding what is other.

I am compulsively creative and love to bring a project to life. The feeling of accomplishment from making an idea become a reality is one of my favorite things in the world. I have explored many different arts and crafts from knitting, sculpting, creating games, and painting.  I found that what I enjoy about creating is the same drive for programming: Inspiration, Flow, and Production. All my energy is now going into code.

I used to work for a weekly newspaper. It has shaped my expectations of work. I thrive in a  fast paced deadline driven environment. I expect to constantly be solving problems and it is highly motivating to me. Working as a team to get the finished product out on time and as best we can is satisfying.

My enthusiasm for production is something I bring to everything in my life.

Thanks for reading,

~Ondine
