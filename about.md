### Project manager and artist who found coding and hasn't looked back.

See what I've been doing on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/RobotMermaid)  

For a peek at my [Resume.](https://goo.gl/ghqBAX)  

Working as a back-end engineer at for Riffyn for 3 years gave me a chance to learn a pretty wide range of valuable experience and skills including: 

* API development
* code maintenance, 
* programming, 
* bugfixing, 
* problem solving, 
* collaborating with product development, 
* data schemas, 
* authentication, 
* aws/containers/docker/kubernetes, 
* agile development, etc.

Plus working with a genuine deployed application, and a pretty complex one for that matter! 

  
I have the skills and training needed to help develop and maintain software programs and to make improvements that will enhance functionality. 
I have outstanding problem solving skills with the ability to work with technical and abstract concepts efficiently. 
I also have solid knowledge of JavaScript, and Python. 
A good understanding of back-end development best practices and hands-on software troubleshooting experience.  
I pay close attention to details and I have the ability to stay focused on the task at hand for long periods to get the job done.  
I love diving into code and figuring out what makes it tick.  
Iâ€™ve been attending conferences and meet-ups at every chance to see what is new such as React and get to know the community. 
I am hungry to learn more (everything?)


#### Me in a nutshell:

* Passionate about company culture
* Get it done type of programmer
* Fluent in Adobe Suites


I am compulsively creative and love to bring a project to life. I'm motivated by feeling of accomplishment from making an idea become a reality. 
I am still mesmerixed by the internet.

I expect to constantly be solving problems and it is highly motivating to me. Working as a team to get the finished product out on time and as best we can is satisfying.


Thanks for reading,

~Ondine
