## Project manager and artist who found coding and hasn't looked back.

I've just finished an extensive boot camp at [Bloc.io](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/bloc) and I'm hoping to find a position as a Front-End Developer to continue learning.  

See what I've been doing on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/RobotMermaid)  
and my progress on [Treehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/ondinemagalirangel)


## Me in a nutshell:

* I love to learn and help others learn too
* I get a kick out of making things
* I play capoeira
* I'm learning to play the ukulele
* I have 1 dog 2 cats 2 chickens and many fish
* I ride a scooter
* I speak French natively, Spanish haltingly, German hesitantly, and KLingon sporadically :)


Growing up I was what is now called a [third culture kid.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid)  I lived in 5 countries before I came to California at 18. The experience made me forever curious about how people think. The internet is a window to the larger world and I can't get enough. I enjoy the challenge of understanding what is other.

I am compulsively creative and love to bring a project to life. The feeling of accomplishment from making an idea become a reality is one of my favorite things in the world. I have explored many different arts and crafts from knitting, sculpting, creating games, and painting.  I found that what I enjoy about creating is the same drive for programming: Inspiration, Flow, and Production. All my energy is now going into code.

I used to work for a weekly newspaper. It has shaped my expectations of work. I thrive in a  fast paced deadline driven environment. I expect to constantly be solving problems and it is highly motivating to me. Working as a team to get the finished product out on time and as best we can is satisfying.

Lately I am fascinated by the incorporation of technology in every day life. The Internet of Things is now a mundane part of our lives and I want to be part of that integration. I want to bridge the gap between software and people.
When I get more time I intend to dive into electronics (Arduinos & LEDs).
My fun thing to do is SVG animations in css and design.

My enthusiasm for production is something I bring to everything in my life.

Iâ€™ve been attending conferences and meetups to get to know the community and see what is new in the industry and I am hungry to learn more (everything?)  

Thanks for reading.
