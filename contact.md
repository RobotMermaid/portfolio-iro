If you made it this far into my website, let me know what you think,  
or if you found a typo, or just to say "hi there mermaid :)".

I am currently looking for a position in a Bay Area software company.
My ideal job is to work for an educational company that will want me to do many animations and web requests.  

I can't relocate at this point but I hope to someday work from Paris, or Auckland, or Singapore...
